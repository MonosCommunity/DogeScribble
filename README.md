## Building / Running

First you'll need to install the Go compiler by followng the instructions at https://go.dev/doc/install.
If you are using a package manager for this, that's fine too.

Next you'll have to download the code via:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/MonosCommunity/DogeScribble.git
cd DogeScribble
```

Lastly to build the executable, run the following:

For -nix systems:
```shell
# run `make` to see all available commands
make build
```

For Windows:
```shell
go build -o scribblers .
```

This will produce a portable binary called `scribblers`. The binary doesn't
have any dependencies and should run on every system as long as it has the
same architecture and OS family as the system it was compiled on.

The default port will be `8080`. The parameter `portHTTP` allows changing the
port though.

You should be able to build the binary on any system that go supports as a compilation target.

This application requires go version `1.16` or higher.
